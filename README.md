## ✨ Overview

**SocialBlog** is a full-featured, multi-user blogging web app. Users can sign up, personalize their profile with an avatar, publish posts, and engage with the community through **comments** and **likes**. It's built with a clean, blueprint-based Flask architecture and a responsive Bootstrap 5 interface.

## 🎬 Demo

<div align="center">

<img src="docs/demo.gif" alt="SocialBlog demo — browse the feed, register, log in, upload an avatar, publish a post, like and comment" width="800" />

*Full walkthrough: browse the feed, register, log in, personalize your profile with an avatar, publish a post, then like and comment.*

## 🚀 Try it in your browser

Don't want to clone anything? Run the **full app** in the cloud with **GitHub Codespaces** — nothing to download or install:

<a href="https://codespaces.new/thany-8/Social_Blog"><img src="https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg" alt="Open in GitHub Codespaces" /></a>

1. Click the badge above (or **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**).
2. Wait ~1 minute while it installs dependencies and seeds demo content.
3. The app starts automatically and a browser tab opens on port **5000** — sign up and start posting.

> Pre-seeded with sample users, posts, comments, and likes. Comment & post moderation runs with the built-in offline screen, so it works with **no API key**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Authentication** — register, log in, and log out with securely hashed passwords (Werkzeug)
- 🧑‍🎨 **User profiles** — upload a profile picture that's automatically resized (Pillow); supports JPG, JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF
- ✍️ **Blog posts** — full create, read, update, and delete (CRUD), restricted to each post's author
- 💬 **Comments** — any logged-in user can comment; a comment can be removed by its **author or the post owner**
- 🛡️ **Comment & post moderation** — every **post and comment** is screened for toxicity **before it's published** via Google's free [Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/), with an offline fallback so it works with zero setup
- ❤️ **Likes** — one-click **toggle** like/unlike per user, with a live like count
- ⚛️ **React interactivity** — polished React "islands" enhance the server-rendered pages: live toxicity preview as you type, async likes and comments (no page reload), and toast notifications
- 📄 **Pagination** — clean, paginated feeds on the home page and user pages
- 🎨 **Modern UI** — responsive Bootstrap 5 design with a styled confirmation modal for deletes
- 🧭 **Custom error pages** — friendly `403` and `404` screens
- 🗃️ **Migrations** — schema managed with Flask-Migrate (Alembic)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**   | Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-Migrate     |
| **Frontend**  | React 18 islands (Vite build) over Jinja2 + Bootstrap 5 |
| **Forms**     | Flask-WTF, WTForms, email-validator                     |
| **Images**    | Pillow                                                  |
| **Database**  | SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (production on Render)         |
| **Auth**      | Werkzeug password hashing, session-based login          |
| **Moderation**| Google Perspective API (with offline keyword fallback)  |

## 🔒 Security

Safety is built in at every layer — essential for a multi-user social app:

- 🛡️ **Toxicity moderation** — every post and comment is screened for toxic or abusive language **before it's saved** (see the **Content Moderation** section below).
- 🔑 **Hashed passwords** — credentials are never stored in plain text (Werkzeug password hashing).
- 🛡️ **CSRF protection** — every form is guarded with Flask-WTF CSRF tokens.
- 🔐 **Authorization checks** — only a post's author can edit or delete it, and a comment can be removed only by its author or the post owner (otherwise a `403`).
- 🗝️ **No insecure defaults** — `SECRET_KEY` is **required** (the app refuses to start without it) and secrets load from a git-ignored `.env`, never committed.
- 🧯 **Fails safe** — if the moderation API is unavailable a local screen still runs, and moderation errors never break posting or commenting.

---

## 🛡️ Content Moderation

Posts and comments are screened **before** they're saved, so toxic or abusive
content never reaches the page.

- **Primary engine — [Google Perspective API](https://perspectiveapi.com/):**
  each comment is scored for `TOXICITY`, `SEVERE_TOXICITY`, `INSULT`,
  `PROFANITY`, `THREAT`, and `IDENTITY_ATTACK`. If any score crosses its
  threshold, the comment is rejected with a friendly message.
- **Zero-config fallback:** with no `PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY` set (or if the API is
  unreachable), a lightweight offline keyword screen keeps the app safe by
  default — the feature works the moment you clone the repo.
- **Fails open:** an unexpected moderation error never blocks commenting.

Enable the full API with a free key:

```bash
export PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY="your-key"   # https://developers.perspectiveapi.com
```

Logic lives in [`socialblog/moderation.py`](socialblog/moderation.py); the tests
mock the API so they run offline:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_moderation
```

---

## ⚛️ Frontend (React islands)

The pages are server-rendered with Jinja2 + Bootstrap, then progressively
enhanced with small **React 18 "islands"** built by **Vite**. This keeps the app
fast and SEO-friendly while adding a modern, app-like feel:

- **Live toxicity preview** — as you type a post or comment, a debounced call to
  `/api/moderate` shows a real-time "Looks respectful ✓" / "May be flagged ⚠"
  pill.
- **Async likes** — like/unlike updates instantly without a page reload.
- **Async comments** — comments post and appear in place, no reload.
- **Toast notifications** — server flash messages and client actions surface as
  elegant toasts.

Each island mounts onto a `data-island="…"` element, so pages still work if
JavaScript is disabled (forms fall back to normal submits). Flask injects the
hashed bundle via a manifest ([`socialblog/vite.py`](socialblog/vite.py)).

**Develop / rebuild the frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build      # outputs to socialblog/static/dist/ (committed so Render needs no Node)
npm run dev        # optional: Vite dev server with HMR
```

> The built bundle in `socialblog/static/dist/` is committed, so the deployed
> app (and Codespaces) serves it directly — no Node step required in production.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or newer
- `pip` and `venv`

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Social_Blog_Flask.git
cd Social_Blog_Flask

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Configure your environment (SECRET_KEY is required; auto-loaded from .env)
cp .env.example .env
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"   # paste as SECRET_KEY in .env

# 5. Create the database tables
flask --app app.py db upgrade

# 6. Run the app
python app.py
```

Then open **https://social-blog-dmrg.onrender.com/** in your browser. 🎉

> 💡 **macOS note:** port `5000` is used by *AirPlay Receiver*. If the server won't start, disable it in **System Settings → General → AirDrop & Handoff → AirPlay Receiver**, or run on another port with `flask --app app.py run --port 5001`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Configuration is read from environment variables. A `.env` file at the project
root is **auto-loaded** on startup (via `python-dotenv`), so the easiest setup is
to copy the template and fill it in:

```bash
cp .env.example .env      # then edit .env
```

| Variable       | Description                                        | Default                          |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `SECRET_KEY`   | Flask secret key used for sessions & CSRF          | **required** (no default)        |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy database URI                            | `sqlite:///socialblog/data.sqlite` |
| `PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY` | Google Perspective API key that enables toxicity moderation | _offline fallback if unset_ |
| `MODERATION_OFFLINE_FALLBACK` | Set to `0` to disable the offline keyword screen | `1` (enabled) |

Generate a strong secret with:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

> 🔒 `SECRET_KEY` is required — the app refuses to start without it. Never commit your real `.env`.
